Before first Hillhacks there was pre-events to raise funds - the slides from this presentation were on the Wiki. Will try and find these to share.

#### What was Hillhacks? Ideas and definition.
#### How will we move forward?
Create a doodle and keep discussing - for past, present and future members to discuss and participate.

### Slideshow
* Two tracks - 
    * Bringing hackers, makers, activists and humanists (sva)
    * Kids and locals (Akiba)
    * Education and Exchange
    * Approach (see slides) - Democracy, meritocary, do-crazy
* "The one who is doing it is in the right"
* If 2 people are doing the same thing, communication is key - make a discussion and consent. 
* We are here together like a family and can be open and give rational arguments.
* Be confident!
* There's no "boss" or "leader" - just make a plan, talk with others - random subset of people, choose more people, if everyone says yes and gives consent then go.
* Who is invited (see slides)
* The curiosity
* CCC (see slides)
  * media.ccc.de (lots in English)
  * events.ccc.de
* Congress Everywhere
* Originally wanted to bring together regions from Pakistan, Kashmir, etc. like 'Nothing will happen' in the Balkans
  * Hackers without borders
  * Freedom
* In the first editions, there were lots of hardware and makers
  * Back then, there wasn't much going on but now there is more local stuff for makers
* 3 Tracks (See slides)
* Invite ALL the people

#### Hardware and Software
There was a bunch of hardware, laptops, soldering irons, etc. Some went to schools, some went to Knowledge garden, laptops distrubuting to centres and children, to Ghoomakad, Jaaga and sometimes breaking.
Akiba bought 1000 dollars of kit and projector

Tools & Software
(See slides)

#### Discussion

Lack of communication and time to organise as everyone gets back to work
Some people need to maintain the engagement throughtout the year 
We try to have some meetup spaces in other cities but they didn't work so well e.g. commuting in BLR
Try hosting once a month, plenty of spaces that will host

#### Ethics and Society
Read up on [Hacker Ethics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker_ethic#The_hacker_ethics) and [History](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker_culture#History) on Wikipedia and give a brief intro, this can lead to a discussion on how it fits now and with culture.
How does it fit in with work? Pressure from parents/society.
How do I earn money as an ethical hacker?
Is it for or against us as a society? - this is the base question as a free and open society. You will probably be happier with a little less money but that's not supporting something bad.

#### Political Issues
Aadhar, networks, free the internet. It's not about politics - it's about human rights. 

#### How do we move on?
How, where, why and when?
This includes everyone - we all have the opportunity to engage. 

What's the connection with Hackbeach?
  * Started as a joke but then people came from Kerala, after a couple of years the idea was born to do something in the south.
  * There is a podcast linked in the mail somewhere - what Hillhacks is about and what Hackbeach could be.
  * Turned more into a hangout of friends to talk about stuff
  * It was suggested to change the tagline to hanging out, other people wanted to keep it the same
  * Last year, nothing was happening. A couple people turned up with a cool project and expected a conference but disappointed. 
  * This year, no commitment for a conference but hanging out was fine. Sva will not be available this year to attend Hackbeach but if others want to continue as a gathering then that's fine. 
  
  People can hang out at the beach whenever, doesn't need to be labelled 'Hackbeach' - if it's labelled then there should be a structure.
  Lack of volunteers to organise Hackbeach. 
  Someone should be active in bringing people in. 
  We should all invite people to make it happen and make it exciting. 
  Suggestion was made that everyone brings a project and if you didn't have a project then you should make one.
  There was also great conversations and discussions
  There is value in exchanging ideas and discussing. 
  There was a queued note system that worked well
  Day of silence idea - only speak via typed comms

Hillhacks was the place for cool maker stuff, now there is less hacking but it's still refreshing to have discussions and reaffirm some values. However, the original pursuit of hacking has maybe been lost.
Learning to solder vs. something more significant? 
If we can find people at different levels of expertise with support this might help towards more actual hacking. 

More introductory stuff e.g. github, soldering, irc, open source etc. 
Each expert could give an intro into something e.g. hacker ethics. 

Some 'people directory' - difficult to figure out if your ideas and projects are appropriate. 
Previously there was something like this - on a volunteer basis - this can be reinstated. Or introduction.

'Hackboard' idea - add your ideas and projects, find the people to work with.

'You can talk to me about...' - give some topics that you can discuss
'I want to learn about...'

Doing this on Etherpads also good idea
Do it at registation - people can either write it up or talk

Hillhackers mailing list happened before the event - the name came first. Also good place for discussion + content on our way of living.

But the actual organisation of the event hasn't happened much on the mailing list. As we were in the same place for the second time, nothing needed to be explained/explored so much and was organised on the spot. 
However, that gave 'apprenticeship' roles for newcomers. 

#### Mailing List
Separate mailing list for the organisation of the event. To keep noise separate. Hillhacks and Hillhackers. Or something Hillhacks-Event. Open and anyone can subscribe but we redefine them. 

#### Venue
We need to be aware that we are a part of the gentrification of these areas. 
We always need a concrete example for venue. 
Alt Campus - hacking space and school in Rakkar. They're open to training people and the founders are connected to the HH and Java scene so they share the values.
It has camp site and rooms being built. They already have some tools. 5 min walk to a place with food, etc. They are committed to staying long-term and continual engagement. 
There is also a law school - we could engage with them about the technical stuff. There is a waste program in Rakkar that we started and is still going. 

A place in Kasol has also been suggested.

Also the option to come back here at Surya - as a fallback, safe option that we know is available. However, if the building is completed with extra rooms then we may not be able to afford to pay for the extra rooms. However, in Art Campus in Rakkar the owners are on site to do some ground work.

At the first HH there was volunteerships - we could do this again and send someone up to do the ground work. 

We still have 2000 Euros of funds available - possibly even more if we needed too. We decided to only use it for something special like a batch project. Another suggestion is a travel fund - come up with a rule set, who can apply and a jury to decide who will get travel/accomm funding. 

This idea will also create differences between each other. It just allows people to get here - travel, accomm and food. 

#### Teams
Remote and onsite team structures might be worth looking at - in the history/wiki.
The FAQ is still very valuable. 
Paying/contribution.
Trekking - before or after. 
These things got a bit lost in the new website. 
Front end and a backend that's editable for everyone to share info like treks etc. 
Maybe we should even have an ugly website again to change expectation management. People asking for tickets.

#### Website and Expectation Management
2 directions - more documentation for newcomers to take forward
Have a formal association that allows for an 'office' or position of authority that can be filled in by anyone to take care of these things. 

Guneet will have connection with the local police this year. An association that can take responsibility for such things. 

Usually people go to tech conferences then find out about HH. Today people see it as a formal event where they want to network, bring work, etc. as they have those expectations. 

How do we respond to those expectations of people looking for these communities?

We can restart the discussion about the association - originally we didn't have one because it was a constant thing. We formed a German union that does exist but idling and about to die - however, it was for funding, etc. It can be idle for 3 years but then you need to do something. Every 2 years you need to do some paperwork. In the end, it couldn't be used in India. It hasn't been discussed recently. 

According to Indian law, the people signed off as the founders of a non-profit, need to have a board meeting every year and some documentation. These liabilities need to be taken on. It could be hassle/responsibility but it does solve many things. As many people taking this respons. would be better.

We could use an already existing company such as IFF. - Not possible.

We had board meetings before over mumble which is possible. However, one long term problem is that there needs to be committed board members. 
At least 3-5 people is standard. 
A company would be the easiest but then you have to show profit every year or you will face an audit. 
Foreign entities need to have an Indian subsidy or it is not possible. 

The issues are with the venue - the owner needs to be liable for the guests. As a group, one person needs to be liable for everyone. 

In India, the word 'hack' is a security risk. The word definitions. 

'Hack the act'

Basically, we need an entity for practical reasons - organising events and having a bank account etc. but without the legal responsbility of being an entity. 

An entity could set up a memorandom - this is how we work.

Everyone will sign a disclaimer and any money paid is not a 'ticket' etc. - it is just adding to the bucket. 

A CoC is standard for conferences, people coming from far for the first time would like something in writing and know where to complain if necessary. 

We agreed a procedure in the past. If something were to happen, we would naturally go to a person that we trust. 

Having a set of rules for a group of hackers is ridiculous and will result in the opposite - we should naturally go to the other side. We only need rules for a logical reason. Instead of a CoC - we have a Code of Rights. Instead of 'you should not do this...' it is 'you have the right to not have this done to you...'. You are responsible for yourself and others. 

2 options
  * A 'normal' CoC - what is expected from us
  * Or a statement such as help.ccc.de where we deny the word CoC but we have a structure of help. Make a recognition of our rights but not have a formal CoC, etc. Name one 'trusted person' for newcomers. 
  
First draft can be written down together - we can think about how were interface with the outside world. 

Could be have a committee - needs an external member. 

Who is the CoC for?

Giving people a good feeling e.g. Having a ladies room.
Should we put our effort into making people feel good instead of CoC.

A write of of HH values rather than 'code of rights'. 

What can you do if you're feeling unsafe - send a mail to help@hillhackers 

Provide new people with enough data/point of contact to feel comfortable. 

Right based approach - form communication. The rights are established by the state. We need to communicate our own values.

Redressal system is enough? 

Moving to a responsibility vs rights approach?

Set up a meeting to make 'Welcome info for mailing list'.

3 people to volunteer to be informal points of contact for anyone who has an issue.

Replicating a Linux set up - pushing the software rep.
