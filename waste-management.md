### Hillhacks Waste Management System

* We will have two separate bins
    * Wet Waste
      * Organic waste - food/plant/vegetation
        * Ideally, meat should be separate due to bacteria
    * Dry Waste
      * Paper, cardboard, glass, plastics, textiles, wood, metal

* We will make a compost bin for the garden in which we can add all of the food waste. 
* The dry waste will be collected and sorted. A local Rag picker will come to the venue to collect it.
