### Previous session examples
* Soldering workshops
* Hulahooping/circus games
* Drag & Drop website making (for older kids)
* Game Design (for younger kids)
  * They made the Gokarna version of GTA

### Nikhil's meeting and suggestions
* Choose one location and do something that can continue until the next HH
* Make one ATL operational
* The local ATL project has identified 5 mentors and has 12 Lakhs to spend
    * There are 3 rooms constructed
    * They _should_ have equipment by next week but this is doubtful
    * Is it possible for someone local to visit a project regularly over the next year
    * The tinkering labs will have wood/metal/material equipment and they can buy kits
* We have been offered time slots on Saturday 9-9.30am and 2-3pm and possibly Monday too

One suggestion is to give more of the tech angle/approach as this is interesting for the school principals. 
They might want to give us better/longer time slots if this is the case.

### Ideas
* Make a soil sensor and show ways of using it
  * Very low cost
* Make people aware of the village internet NOFN and VLE scheme
* '5 Second Rule'
* How does paragliding work
* Music
* Encryption lesson/game
