### Discussion Sequel

Hacker ethics/culture and HH started off more 'underground' on the edge of the establishment.

Now hacker culture/ethics is in a different context - technology is everywhere and it's not utopian.

Old and new world to be brought together. We need to sensitise ourselves to the past and present and look toward the future.

Start projects around good cause, don't do tech for techs sake. At least try to solve problems of another domain. 

#### Expectations we set for newcomers. 

Should we be a formal org or not?

Initially, people were just doing things for fun at HH not necessarily for society. This was missing from this year.

We can't just be gathering here to solve society. Hacking came from just being interested, fiddling with things, demoscene, etc.

What is our responsibility at a space like this? Just to use the resources, how will you raise the bar for yourself? 

If we're going to a space then we need to engage with the community. 

Making a community, we always have to ask - who are we leaving out? It's a tough question, I don't have an answer but we have to think about it. A conference usually as a framework. What has happened is HH is too open-ended. There is no centre for HH.

#### Comments from newcomers

The contrast from my first HH to now is that people here were always making/tinkering at that's my expectation. That's what I told people to come. 

A question for newcomers, what did you expect to find here? Where would you take it?

Expected more effort for presentations which I felt was lacking. 

A gathering of people, being and knowing about different things - if you like it you can collaborate. Now i think, if you want an end-goal of collaboration then the onus is on the senior people - do they want an entity to be attached with projects. It's a question for myself, what do they want to forsee? It's a blank space.

It's my second year, so my experience compared with last year is that last time was relaxed but also lots of things happening. It didn't matter which area you came from. This year is a smaller scale but it felt like there was clearly there was some spaces/sessions where there were a lot of people talking but not listening. It could be an issue that there is a small number of people managing it. This year was a bit of a challenge for me to feel a part of.

To share, hear new voices. Tech and activism. 

To find a hack base. 

Maybe it's worth going back to a more tech based setup. I was expecting more entry-level stuff and a lot of it was more specific. This time there wasn't sessions to choose from. 

Instead of 'things I want to talk about', I want to learn. Now I don't know the expectation from the new attendees. 

#### Comparisons to previous years

Codecamp was one of the important parts of HH, this year we it changed the format as there was less people. If we focus more on making. 

It's a common thing - we want more 'doing'. Not a lot of people are coming to do and learn.

There has been less actual making stuff - hands on doing things. Another thing emerging is that we need to put our topics/projects into our context. One of the most important things I want to do is make sure these spaces continue to thrive - to challenge the bigger systems. 

The conference itself was a multi-day project in itself - you have to come and put this space together and make stuff happen. 

Participate not attend.

#### Ideas for future events

Either you bring a project or you join a project - this notion was brought up. This could be added to the registration. 

The workshop room was empty the whole time - there was no kit in there and it wasn't clear what kit there was.

There is some planning to do workshops - there should be a digital inventory so we know what kit we have. 

It's also up to you to say 'teach me this'.

That's hard as a newcomer. 

Question in every meeting 'what do you want to learn?'

People can suggest an idea 'I want to do this, if enough people are interested'

Some of the people that come here and don't have there expectations met, they become like an anti-hack person or say HH is overrated. Nothing organised was going on. 

Someone needs to be a driver - every year 5-6 people end up driving every year. People ask 'we need someone to do this' - who is that someone?

We need people to work together to make this happen before the actual conference. 

Normally at an unconference, it should be that the schedule happens organically. 

HH changes every year depending on the participants and I think that's a good thing. 

If someone doesn't volunteer to do all the updates, etc. no one turns up. This year, everything happened very late. 

We can have this conversation again in 6 months time then no one will show up. The reason it happens is the core set of people decide to do it and set a structure.

The communication shouldn't be a blip, it should be more consistent. 

Should we ask people to commit? Should we ask people, do you want HH to happen again? If yes, are you willing to commit.

If we had some communication before, we could plan projects in advance. 

For example, the sensor project could be taken up again. 

The 31st of May is not the end of something, it's just a pause. 

If we can take something from this and continue it throughout the year. 

I now feel more of a responsibilty and am inspired to learn electronics and hardware so I can offer more skills in the next HH or other events like this.

I'd like to organise monthly meetups in Bangalore to discuss HH and tinker. Other people could do this too.

Supreeth and Joy are committing their spaces to plan/make.

It doesn't have to be a big commitment. 

We could use these meetups in cities to start maintaining wikipages etc. 

We can have video calls to discuss things. 

We could have HH as different verticals - the conference, workshops, networking/hanging out, engaging in the local area.

We have a team structure on wiki. 

Others don't want to separate things too strictly. 

#### Documentation - different viewpoints

There's a lack of documentation - there should be more about what we did, workshops, school projects etc.

Documentation is overrated. Get out of the mindset of having a ruleset. 

Without documentation - we wouldn't have a job right now. 

Hacker ethos is not about learning from scratch, it's learning from previous work too.

It is very useful to know what was done in the past, at the school projects for example, to know what we should do this year. 

I'm saying documentation is not necessary to do a project - you don't need a rulebook. 

Instead of a rulebook - an archive or history. 

I wanted to bring up the notion of Open Source and hacker ethos. It's something that can exclude but also bring together. 

#### Venue and date discussion

The venue and date are up for date. Some people want to do it higher in the mountains because of the heat.

It's possible that Surya might not be available next year. We can keep the trunks here. 

Moving location also helps us work harder to make it happen and think of new ideas.

Let's make a new venue page with pro's and con's. 

There are several places that are around 7 hours away from Delhi. 

The Delhi guys can go and explore each possible location/venue. Many of us go to Himachal every few months anyway.

Internet, camping, places nearby - these are all things to consider. This could also be part of the hacking. 

Some of the issues we face, could be addressed if we document our values together. 

Two ways to document - look at history or write new.

We need to better document the recent years, even the Twitter is a way to show the narrative. 

We need to recognise that HH happens during exam time for students. Maybe later - late May-June. 

#### Defining HH and values

Does everyone agree we need to define our values?

We can do it on Wiki - it's more inclusive and anyone can edit.
